      <h1>Welcome to Finland</h1>
      <p>
        Finland is a Northern European nation bordering Sweden, Norway and
        Russia. Its capital, Helsinki, occupies a peninsula and surrounding
        islands in the Baltic Sea. Helsinki is home to the 18th-century sea
        fortress Suomenlinna, the fashionable Design District and diverse
        museums. The Northern Lights can be seen from the country's Arctic
        Lapland province, a vast wilderness with national parks and ski resorts.

        Helsinki Cathedral is the Finnish Evangelical Lutheran cathedral of the
        Diocese of Helsinki, located in the neighborhood of Kruununhaka in the
        centre of Helsinki, Finland at the Senate Square. The church was

        Finland, Tsar Nicholas I of Russia. It was also known as St Nicholas's
        Church until the independence of Finland in 1917. It is a major landmark
        of the city, and possibly the most famous structure in Finland as a
        whole when viewed globally.
